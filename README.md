This project demonstrates a simple Kafka streaming setup using Python. It includes a Hello Producer that sends messages to a Kafka topic and a Hello Consumer that reads and processes those messages. This is a basic example to help you get started with Kafka streaming using the confluent-kafka Python library.
Prerequisites:
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
Apache Kafka: Download and set up Kafka from the official website.
Python 3.x: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
confluent-kafka Python library: Install the library using pip:
        pip install confluent-kafka
producer.py: A Python script that acts as a Kafka producer, sending messages to a Kafka topic.
consumer.py: A Python script that acts as a Kafka consumer, reading messages from the Kafka topic.
